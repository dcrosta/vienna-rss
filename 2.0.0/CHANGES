2.0.0.2003
----------
- Add an option to mark the current article read after X seconds where X is configurable
  through the preferences. The default is to mark read only after the user has done
  View->Next Unread.
- Fix import/export to convert characters such as <, > and & to and from their entity equivalents
  in URL fields as per XML specification.
- Add View->Article Page to display the original web page from which the article came. The short
  cut for this is 'P'. The command toggles between the web page and the original article.
