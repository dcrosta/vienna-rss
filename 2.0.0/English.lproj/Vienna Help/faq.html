<p class="style1">Some of the frequently asked questions during the Vienna pre-release testing.</p>
<p class="style1">Q: I have both Parlance  and Vienna on my machine. When I click a cix: link in Vienna, it always attempts to open the link with Parlance.</p>
<p class="style1">A: This is because Parlance is also registered as the default handler for cix: links. In the event of multiple applications registering to handle the same link type, the OS picks a winner. However it is possible to manually set the active handler via the Preferences. In Preferences, choose the CIX tab and set Vienna as the default CIX links handler.</p>
<p class="style1">Q: My database is rather large.</p>
<p class="style1">A: Vienna uses SQLite as the database engine and it can generate rather large databases. Future revisions of SQLite may improve on the storage usage although probably not dramatically. Note that SQLite does not automatically reduce the database size when you delete topics or conferences so you should consider running the Compact Database command from the File menu afterwards.</p>
<p class="style1">Q: How do message styles work?</p>
<p class="style1">A: Vienna automatically renders words or phrases between * characters in bold. Similarly it renders words or phrases between / in italics and _ as underlined. This is a CIX convention supported by most off-line readers.</p>
<p class="style1">To create text in bold when entering a message, simply surround the text with * characters. One restriction is that you cannot run styles across lines. So the start and end of the style character must appear on the same line otherwise the style will not be rendered. In addition, the end style must be followed by any of these characters: space, newline, tab, comma, full-stop, question mark, exclamation mark or closing parenthesis.</p>
<p class="style1">Q: Why doesn't the pound sign render in messages that I create from Vienna even though it renders in messages created by Ameol?</p>
<p class="style1">A: This is a limitation of Vienna that should be fixed in a future version. Any character that is not part of the 7-bit ASCII range will not be transmitted properly in messages posted from Vienna. </p>
