<p>Vienna is an application that allows you to read RSS or Atom news feeds on your Mac OSX computer. It automates the
job of retrieving news articles from all subscribed feeds and storing them in a local database for reading off-line. It
provides features that allow you to search feeds for keywords or phrases, tag articles with a flag for future reference
and organise related feeds together under groups. You can create smart folders that make it easy to dynamically retrieve
and view all articles in the database that match a search criteria. The built-in web browser allows you to go to the
articles web page or view links in the article directly in Vienna in separate tabs.</p>
<p>Vienna is designed to be simple and easy to use. A clean, uncluttered, interface maximises the space for articles and
just a few controls are needed to perform the most common actions in the user interface.</p>
