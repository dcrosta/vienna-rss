Vienna To-Do File
=================

Update this file with a list of things that users have requested but which aren't yet implemented.
Thanks!

- Improve ParseXmlDate in XMLParser.m. Make it more efficient.
- Add support for RSS comments. General idea: have RichXMLParser grab the # of comments and the URI to the comment feed
  for each messageand store them. Have SingleConnection grab this info and determine if the comment feed need to be grabbed
  (how?). Then after the connection has completed and the app controller notified, have the handler check to see if the
  comments feed is needed and create new SingleConnection objects just for the comments. The new object will have to know
  the ID of the original messages.
- Add built-in web browser.
